Input files for the DISPLACE Eastern Ionian Sea application

The DISPLACE Eastern Ionian Sea application (FAO GFCM GSA 20) was initially developed with detailed conditioning in Maina et al., 2021 and is currently being further refined in the SEAWISE project (https://seawiseproject.org/) under Task 5.5.
The DISPLACE model (Bastardie et al., 2014, www.displace-project.org) integrates simulation tools to evaluate biological, economic, and energy efficiency impacts of various fisheries management options under different conditions. It operates with high spatial and temporal resolution, simulating individual vessels and their unique schedules, capturing variability in fishing behavior.
